            "I feel i am dynamic Gen Z professional who effortlessly manages a triple life, excelling in content creation, public relations, and entrepreneurship. 
             As a content creator, I started with blogging and transitioned to video content, gaining prominence on platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. Contrary to the misconception of content creators being mere consumers of internet content, my dedication to spending the majority of my time creating rather than consuming.
            In my professional life, I am a Public Relations and Advertising graduate, having entered the industry as an intern at the age of 19. My current role as a Junior Account Executive at the award-winning PR agency Atteline, I thrive in combining my love for writing and creativity with the opportunity to help brands establish their presence. The job not only allows me to create impactful campaigns but also offers valuable interactions with like-minded professionals across various industries.
            Adding another dimension to my life, I embarked on an entrepreneurial venture during the pandemic, launching Zileke, a body jewelry brand specializing in waist beads. The business was born out of my frustration in finding the perfect waist bead for myself, leading me to learn the craft and eventually start my own brand. Zileke has become a fulfilling passion project, providing a therapeutic outlet for stress relief through the intricate process of creating jewelry."
